Picasso is a node.js plugin, intended for those who want to add color to their console output.

It's pretty easy to set up. It just needs to be imported, and it's very self-explanatory.

This project declares colors as ANSI-escapes on global variables, so you can call them everytime you need from anywhere.

Browse the code itself to find help on syntax. Also, you can run it with "test" as arg, so you can see a demo output.
